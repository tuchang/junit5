/**
* {@code ThrowingConsumer} is a functional interface that can be used to implement any generic
* block of code that consumes an argument and potentially throws a {@link Throwable}.
*
* <p>The {@code ThrowingConsumer} interface is similar to {@link java.util.function.Consumer},
* except that a {@code ThrowingConsumer} can throw any kind of exception, including checked
* exceptions.
*
* <h4>Rationale for throwing {@code Throwable} instead of {@code Exception}</h4>
*
* <p>Although Java applications typically throw exceptions that are instances of {@link
* java.lang.Exception}, {@link java.lang.RuntimeException}, {@link java.lang.Error}, or {@link
* java.lang.AssertionError} (in testing scenarios), there may be use cases where a {@code
* ThrowingConsumer} needs to explicitly throw a {@code Throwable}. In order to support such
* specialized use cases, {@link #accept} is declared to throw {@code Throwable}.
