/**
* {@code ThrowingSupplier} is a functional interface that can be used to implement any generic
* block of code that returns an object and potentially throws a {@link Throwable}.
*
* <p>The {@code ThrowingSupplier} interface is similar to {@link java.util.function.Supplier},
* except that a {@code ThrowingSupplier} can throw any kind of exception, including checked
* exceptions.
*
* <h4>Rationale for throwing {@code Throwable} instead of {@code Exception}</h4>
*
* <p>Although Java applications typically throw exceptions that are instances of {@link Exception},
* {@link RuntimeException}, {@link Error}, or {@link AssertionError} (in testing scenarios), there
* may be use cases where a {@code ThrowingSupplier} needs to explicitly throw a {@code Throwable}.
* In order to support such specialized use cases, {@link #get} is declared to throw {@code
* Throwable}.
