/**
* Maintained common support API provided by the JUnit Platform.
*
* <p>The purpose of this package is to provide {@code TestEngine} and {@code Extension} authors
* convenient access to a subset of internal utility methods helping with their implementation. This
* prevents re-inventing the wheel and ensures that common tasks are handled in the same way as
* within the JUnit Platform.
