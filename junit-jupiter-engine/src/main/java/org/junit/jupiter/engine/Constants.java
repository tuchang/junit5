	* Property name used to provide a pattern for deactivating conditions: {@value}
	*
	* <h3>Pattern Matching Syntax</h3>
	*
	* <p>If the pattern consists solely of an asterisk ({@code *}), all conditions will be
	* deactivated. Otherwise, the pattern will be used to match against the fully qualified class
	* name (<em>FQCN</em>) of each registered condition. Any dot ({@code .}) in the pattern will
	* match against a dot ({@code .}) or a dollar sign ({@code $}) in the FQCN. Any asterisk ({@code
	* *}) will match against one or more characters in the FQCN. All other characters in the pattern
	* will be matched one-to-one against the FQCN.
	*
	* <h3>Examples</h3>
	*
	* <ul>
	*   <li>{@code *}: deactivates all conditions.
	*   <li>{@code org.junit.*}: deactivates every condition under the {@code org.junit} base package
	*       and any of its subpackages.
	*   <li>{@code *.MyCondition}: deactivates every condition whose simple class name is exactly
	*       {@code MyCondition}.
	*   <li>{@code *System*}: deactivates every condition whose simple class name contains {@code
	*       System}.
	*   <li>{@code org.example.MyCondition}: deactivates the condition whose FQCN is exactly {@code
	*       org.example.MyCondition}.
	* </ul>
